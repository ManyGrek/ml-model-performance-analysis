    "## Separate the dataset\n",
    "Because we do not want to test our model with the same data we trained it, we choose to separate our dataset in three groups. The train data is the 60% of the dataset because we want the most of the data to be use to train the model, so we can have a model more \"experienced\". We split the other part of the model because we want to validate our model before we test it to the final.\n",
    "\n",
    "This validation process is need, because most of the time, the hyperparameters we choose are not the most optimal, and we want to score the model a couple of times before doing the final test. Because this process is do it iteratively, we can overfit the model to the validation test even manually; that's why we have the last dataset separately, and we choose to use only at the end of the proces.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of splitting the test set into validation set and test set can be avoided with something called Cross-Validation, but let's talk about it later."
